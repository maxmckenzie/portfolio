    <p>Iâ€™m a full stack developer based in Barcelona. I enjoy designing and building APIs and UIs with modern tools like ES6, Vue, React, Webpack, Nightwatch, Mocha, PostgreSQL, and GraphQL.</p>
    <p>Over the course of my nine-year career, I have worked for agencies, SaaS providers, and publishers. Taking on the roles of technical writer, tech lead, project manager, consultant, company director, and of course, front-line pixel pusher.</p>
    <p>This portfolio is built with Vue and Webpack. It uses a simple node <a href="http://api.maxmckenzie.uk/" target="_blank">API</a> which scrapes data from GitHub and StackOverflow. If you feel so inclined, you can access all my CV and portfolio data via the below curl command.</p>
    <pre class="request"><code class>$ curl http://api.maxmckenzie.uk/</code></pre>
    <p>You can find the source code for <a href="https://github.com/maxmckenzie/portfolio">This vue app</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/maxmckenzie/portfolio-api">API</a> on Github</p>
    <p>The more data heavy endpoints on this site I've templated out to make it easier to read. But for simple lists (like below) I've just outputted the raw JSON</p>
    <pre><code>apiData.details</code></pre> 
    <pre class="responce">{{ apiData.details }}</pre>
