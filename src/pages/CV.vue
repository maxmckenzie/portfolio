                <p>"Max is a highly skilled and reliable developer. I worked with Max for one year at Tribal Worldwide and during that time I quickly got to know and appreciate Maxâ€™s skills. Max has good knowledge of front end development, he has experience with working on large scale web sites for big name clients, he is able to work under pressure and can be relied upon to devise fitting solutions given tight time constraints which I feel is a valuable trait which is lacking in a lot of todays developers".</p>

He's a talented front-end coder, is sharp and gets it, and ultimately is a doer - someone you want on your team. He came for a couple of weeks contract, and stayed over a year".</p>
